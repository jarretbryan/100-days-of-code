# 100 Days Of Code - jaybeekeeper

### Day 1: May 25, 2020 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Drafted a bash script to bulk delete repositories from my github account.

**Thoughts:**  I would love to turn it into a more user (*me* specifically) friendly ruby gem. Saved the script as a secret github gist. 

Separately, upgraded homebrew and yarn on my local machine.

I need to plan ahead for the next iteration of my personal site. 

**Link to work:** N/A
