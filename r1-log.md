### R1D1 
Drafted a bash script to bulk delete repositories from my github account. I would love to turn it into a more user (me specifically) friendly ruby gem. Saved the script as a secret github gist. 

Separately, upgrade homebrew and yarn on my local machine.

I need to plan ahead for the next iteration of my personal site.
